* Server
A simple server for handling JSON requests. Parses a json file and uses the structure to serve requests.

To build a docker image, use
#+begin_src shell
nix-build docker.nix
#+end_src
To load it, use
#+begin_src shell
docker load < result
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src shell
docker load -i result
#+end_src

To run it,
#+begin_src shell
docker run sstoltze/server:latest
#+end_src

Unfortunately, I can't figure out a good way to expose the port more globally to the host. Various experiments have failed. But a way of accessing it is to get the name with =docker ps= (in the case it was =fervent_bhaskara=) and running
#+begin_src shell
docker inspect fervent_bhaskara | jq '.[0] | .NetworkSettings | .Networks | .bridge | .IPAddress'
#+end_src
and then accessing =<ip-from-the-command-above>:5000=.
